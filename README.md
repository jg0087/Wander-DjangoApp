# :loop: Next Steps
- Customize the privacy settings of my shared itinerary, so that I can choose which ones are shared publicly and which ones are kept private.

- Filter and sort public itineraries based on criteria such as location, duration, and type of activities, so that I can find relevant and suitable travel plans more efficiently.

- Save or bookmark tourist attractions from other users' itineraries, so that I can easily add them to my own travel plans later.
